  [Bob van Loosen]
   * fixed: when doing a format conversion from float to 32 bit int, multiply with INT32_MAX - 127, since this is the maximum value that can be stored in 32 bit float and int, if INT32_MAX gets converted to float, it gets rounded to INT32_MAX + 1 which can cause wrap around distortion

  [LeechGuy]
   * Remove setting of special://profile path from OnSettingsLoading(); special://profile path is already set to the correct path when the settings are being loaded.

  [LeechGuy]
   * When ProfilesManager::m_currentProfile is changed the special://profile path must be updated as well. Added SetCurrentProfileId() function for manipulating m_currentProfile. Replaced all occurances of direct manipulation by using this function. This makes sure that the special://profile path is updated as well when updating the current profile id. Since SetCurrentProfileId() is called in ProfilesManager::Load(), the special://profile path is now automatically set which made it obsolete in CApplication::Create().

  [LeechGuy]
   * Update special://profile before attempting to load the profile's guisettings.xml file.

  [Simon Vetter]
   * JSONRPCServer, AirPlayServer: listen on ipv6 if available. Try to open an ipv6 socket and disable IPV6_V6ONLY to make it dual stack. If we can't get a socket because ipv6 is not supported at runtime (i.e. ipv6.ko not loaded), fallback to ipv4.

  [Simon Vetter]
   * WebServer: if ipv6 is available, try to start two MHD instances, one on ipv6, then one on ipv4. On dual-stack systems where listening on ipv6 also accepts ipv4 connections (at least OSX), only one thread will be used and serve both address families. On others, two threads will be started.

  [arnova]
   * fixed: We can only obtain the aspect & duration this way when the Process() thread is running (and UpdatePlayState() has been called at least once) else CApp will race getting the streamdetails on player start and get 0 for ratio/duration. In that case fallback to info from the demuxer

  [arnova]
   * fixed: Move storing of streamdetails from CApp::PlayFile() to the SaveFileState-job, where it already partially was (for DVD stuff). This fixes a few issues: - Races causing possible invalid streamdetails to be stored in the db; - Stream details for current file were not stored when item was not in the db yet; - Check whether the streamdetails in the db need updating by comparing. This fixes also fixes previously invalid/incomplete stored details; - Also clarify the special case for DVD stuff.

  [arnova]
   * fixed: We can only obtain the aspect & duration this way when the Process() thread is running (and UpdatePlayState() has been called at least once) else CApp will race getting the streamdetails on player start and get 0 for ratio/duration. In that case fallback to info from the demuxer

  [arnova]
   * fixed: Move storing of streamdetails from CApp::PlayFile() to the SaveFileState-job, where it already partially was (for DVD stuff). This fixes a few issues: - Races causing possible invalid streamdetails to be stored in the db; - Stream details for current file were not stored when item was not in the db yet; - Check whether the streamdetails in the db need updating by comparing. This fixes also fixes previously invalid/incomplete stored details; - Also clarify the special case for DVD stuff.

   * fixed: Instead of checking whether the item is video, check whether we're playing video else we may obtain invalid info due to racing

  [arnova]
   * changed: When checking for eg. user thumbs just check whether it's either a folder or a video file

  [arnova]
   * fixed: We can only obtain the aspect & duration this way when the Process() thread is running (and UpdatePlayState() has been called at least once) else CApp will race getting the streamdetails on player start and get 0 for ratio/duration. In that case fallback to info from the demuxer

  [arnova]
   * fixed: Move storing of streamdetails from CApp::PlayFile() to the SaveFileState-job, where it already partially was (for DVD stuff). This fixes a few issues: - Races causing possible invalid streamdetails to be stored in the db; - Stream details for current file were not stored when item was not in the db yet; - Check whether the streamdetails in the db need updating by comparing. This fixes also fixes previously invalid/incomplete stored details; - Also clarify the special case for DVD stuff.

  [arnova]
   * fixed: We can only obtain the aspect & duration this way when the Process() thread is running (and UpdatePlayState() has been called at least once) else CApp will race getting the streamdetails on player start and get 0 for ratio/duration. In that case fallback to info from the demuxer

  [arnova]

This fixes a few issues: - Races causing possible invalid streamdetails to be stored in the db; - Stream details for current file were not stored when item was not in the db yet; - Check whether the streamdetails in the db need updating by comparing. This fixes also fixes previously invalid/incomplete stored details; - Also clarify the special case for DVD stuff.

  [arnova]
   * fixed: We can only obtain the aspect & duration this way when the Process() thread is running (and UpdatePlayState() has been called at least once) else CApp will race getting the streamdetails on player start and get 0 for ratio/duration. In that case fallback to info from the demuxer

  [arnova]
   * fixed: Move storing of streamdetails from CApp::PlayFile() to the SaveFileState-job, where it already partially was (for DVD stuff). This fixes a few issues: - Races causing possible invalid streamdetails to be stored in the db; - Stream details for current file were not stored when item was not in the db yet; - Check whether the streamdetails in the db need updating by comparing. This fixes also fixes previously invalid/incomplete stored details; - Also clarify the special case for DVD stuff.

  [arnova]
   * fixed: We can only obtain the aspect & duration this way when the Process() thread is running (and UpdatePlayState() has been called at least once) else CApp will race getting the streamdetails on player start and get 0 for ratio/duration. In that case fallback to info from the demuxer

This fixes a few issues: - Races causing possible invalid streamdetails to be stored in the db; - Stream details for current file were not stored when item was not in the db yet; - Check whether the streamdetails in the db need updating by comparing. This fixes also fixes previously invalid/incomplete stored details; - Also clarify the special case for DVD stuff.

  [WiSo]

  [Memphiz]
   * [fix] - when paplayer gets stopped in the last 5 secs where the next stream is already slaved the stop is blocked until the next track starts (no clue draining the stream i guess). In that case the onplaybackstarted callback for the next track is fired even if we are about to stop. In the message handler the current playlist is fetched and accessed directly with [] operator without checking if the playlist is still valid. This leads to bad access crashing because the playlist is empty already when the started message gets processed. This fix just fetches the playlist and checks the size before accessing the playlist item - fixes #13792

   * [nfs] - we need to refresh the last accessed time of the used context aswell when we reset the filehandle last accessed time. There was a race with PAPlayer where track1 was still opened and the context was nearly timed out - then track2 got opened shortly before track1 was closed and requested the context which was now timed out already - so the open of track2 destroyed the context and created a new one - now track1 was read again with the already destroyed context - booom.

  [Memphiz]

   * [release] bump version to 12.0rc1


  [Memphiz]
   * [vda/vtb] - videocoreref is flipped in y direction - somehow this influences the rendercapture image in a way that it is flipped in y too (relevant for the bookmarks and boblight). glReadPixels always returns a y flipped image - so we flip it via matrices before rendering the capture image - for corevideobuf we now skip the flip for fixing the upside down bookmarks (commented with fixme - because we still don't understand why this is affecting rendercapture at all)

  [Memphiz]
   * [dvdinputstream] - remove any "

  [Memphiz]
   * [win32] - bump libshairplay - restart of airtunes service is fixed now (the http server sockets weren't closed on server stop)

  [Memphiz]
   * [cosmetic] - remove stupid leftover from last commit

  [Memphiz]
   * [osx] - since the osx windowing refactoring and sdk 10.6 bump we don't need to diddle with hiding the dock on resume anymore. The applescript approach had a flaw which just toggled the autohide option systemwide - which would overwrite usersettings. Just get rid of that cocoa stuff for autodock hiding and let the osx windowing do its magic.

  [Memphiz]
   * [nfs] - fix possible crash due to a race condition between context timeout and filehandle keepalive. This is related to / addition fix for #13505

  [ronie]
   * [confluence] extended weather

  [pieh]
   * don't wait for scanner thread to finish when stoping scan, fixes #13535


  [montellese]
   * DatabaseUtils: degrade level of (mostly) unimportant log message

  [montellese]
   * settings: update videoscreen.screenmode value when updating to Frodo


  [Memphiz]
   * [AE/CA] - stop and start the engine in makestream only when we need to reinit due to format change or when we are NOT called with the AESTREAM_PAUSED option. (AESTREAM_PAUSED is set from paplayer) - this should further reduce the hickup with slaved streams in paplayer

  [Memphiz]
   * [AE/CA] - reduce streamlock time in makestream

  [Memphiz]
   * [AE/CA] - if m_volume of the stream is set (e.x. <= 1.0) we have to apply the softvolume to the stream. Before we only applied the volume on crossfade. Unfortunatly the fade was finished before the stream was finished - so the last frames of the sream during crossfade had full volume applied (you can imagine how this disturbs the fading ;) ).

  [montellese]
   * CGUIWindowSettingsCategory: don't allow to choose a non-existing audio device

  [montellese]
   * settings: migrate old audiooutput.channellayout setting to audiooutput.channels and reset audiooutput.audiodevice if necessary

  [montellese]
   * settings: rename audiooutput.channellayout to audiooutput.channels as it's not backwards-compatible

  [montellese]
   * CAEFActory: add VerifyOutputDevice() implementation

  [montellese]
   * [win32] AE: change default sink to DirectSound (over WASAPI)


  [montellese]
   * [win32] add basic error logging if D3DXCreateEffect() fails in CD3DEffect::CreateEffect() without a specific error message

  [wsoltys]
   * [WIN] fixed #13581: XBMCVFS.Exists() not working correctly. wstat does only work on directories inside a share and not on the share itself. Even though the same should be true for GetFileAttributesW (according to the M$ docs) it works for the tested environments.

  [Harald Axmann]
   * [pvr] Save path history on PVR window unload, so that it is available when the window is restored.

  [Harald Axmann]
   * [pvr] Show last view when restoring the PVR window.


  [Lars Op den Kamp]
   * [pvr] don't try to set an invalid audio stream id in the player. fixes 'failed to get stream' errors

  [Lars Op den Kamp]
   * [pvr] wider range of accepted values for pvrplayback.channelentrytimeout

  [Lars Op den Kamp]
   * [pvr] invert pvrplayback.confirmchannelswitch setting, and use the value of pvrplayback.channelentrytimeout as autoclose value. closes #13480

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * fix screenshots in the edit media source dialog

  [Memphiz]
   * [nfs] - fix possible crash. When keeping alive the open filehandlers we need to refresh the lastaccessedtime of the used context aswell. Else a still used context can be destroyed leading to a crash. fixes #13505 - thx alot to cyberwizzard for tracking that one down

  [Memphiz]
   * [dns-cache] - fix dnscache lookup. The current code assumed that the strIpAddress parameter was an empty string. That wasn't the case for e.x. nfs. In the case the nmblookup failed - but the caller has given a non-empty string in strIpAddress - this string was cached for the given hostname and returned back with return true. This fixes the problem by clearing the strIpAddress param before starting lookups. Thx to drloco for pointing it out.

  [arnova]
   * changed: Make user file thumbs overrule embedded art in music files

  [Alasdair Campbell]
   * upnp: fix missing music info on BrowseMetadata calls fixes #13554

  [montellese]
   * smartplaylists: make "title" field browseable (again)

  [Alasdair Campbell]

  [Chris "Koying" Browet]
   * FIX: regenerate auto-thumb if not present


  [montellese]
   * jsonrpc: remove unsupported PVR channel related properties from "List.Item.File"

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * don't set no art as '-' in the database, as it makes ListItem.Art(foo) non-empty, thus breaking fallbacks

  [Lars Op den Kamp]
   * [pvr] fixed - check the add-on API version before calling Create(), check the minimum version XBMC uses and not the one from the add-on, log versions and path when the add-on is incompatible

  [Lars Op den Kamp]
   * [cec] fixed - don't store the vendor id of the tv that libCEC sends back, or this will be used as vendorid forever

  [montellese]
   * videodb: add triggers on deletion of movies/tvshows/musicvideos to delete any related records in the taglinks table (fixes #13544)

  [montellese]
   * mysql: don't remove "BEGIN" and "END" from CREATE TRIGGER queries (thanks koying)


  [Memphiz]
   * [osx] - fix vfs wrapper (10.6.sdk added 2 new symbols for stat and fstat). This fixes playback of dvd folders when started from the library



  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * [cosmetic] indenting after try/catch in GetStreamDetails

   * Remove useless crossfade selection enable test - thx JM

  [Damian Huckle]
   * Remove old code disabling crossfade selection with WASAPI - fixes #13518

  [Memphiz]
   * [AE/CA] - only reinit the engine on makestream if pcm format changes or always on raw format - this significantly reduces a hickup we have when preparing the next stream in paplayer - though there is still an audible hickup :(

  [arnova]
   * fixed: AE suspending was broken resulting in it resuming/suspending over and over again (fixes ticket #13508)

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * [gles] no need to blend if we have no alpha

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * [gles] ensure we use the NOBLEND texture shader only if no diffuse color is specified. fixes #13558.



  [Cyril]
   * Add plugin:// resolving before queueing next track

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * ensure we serialize all members of CMusicInfoTag. fixes issues with art vanishing on large lists from the music library after it's loaded off the filesystem.

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * use an int for CMusicInfoTag::m_iDbId rather than a long

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * [extendedprogressbar] ensure window close animations are run. fixes #13566.

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * [extendedprogressbar] refactor UpdateState to ensure m_iCurrentItem is always valid, so that we don't close the dialog prematurely

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * [extendedprogressbar] reset m_iCurrentItem on window init

  [Christian Fetzer]
   * pvr: Sort recordings view by date as default (most recent recording on top)

  [Cory Fields]
   * [aml/droid] build static build-side pcre

  [bobo1on1]
   * fixed: set the default of audiooutput.normalizelevels to true to restore the default behavior lost in a743caa061f3f2979343eb69600deba6e1417a4f

  [Andres Mejia]
   * Remove erroneous check for shairport/ao.h, fixes build failure for airtunes support.

  [ronie]
   * remove broken slideshow screensaver

  [bobo1on1]
   * fixed: no need for RunLimiter prototype in IAEStream

  [pieh]
   * reset m_focusedControl in CGUIControlGroup::ClearAll() fixes focus staying in middle of setting list when jumping through setting tabs

  [pieh]
   * DialogSelect: autoselect first item if no item was preselected fixes focus staying on same item when we show dialog next time

  [Jonathan Marshall]
   * don't blindly add slashes at the end of sources. fixes #13550

  [Jonathan Fabian]
   * Ensure that the previous menu action is not handled in a list/panel container - it is handled at the window level

  [Jonathan Fabian]
   * Correct the GUIDialogKeyboard class to ignore non-printing unicode values

  [pieh]
   * GUIDialogSelect: get rid of not needed m_vecListInternal and just use m_vecList (we don't store pointer to external list anymore)

  [pieh]
   * change CGUIDialogSelect::SetItems() to create copy of list instead of just setting pointer to it fixes crash when reloading skin while select dialog is active

  [pieh]
   * AddonBrowser: check if dialog was confirmed instead of checking if it wasn't multiselection and if anything was selected. We might skip CGUIDialogSelect::OnBack when we close dialog (for example when we reload skin).

  [dragonflight]
   * Don't delete paths that have exclude or strSettings set and don't delete paths that are refered to by other tables as parentID

  * XBMC 12 Beta1
